# Liri bot

LIRI is similiar in all aspects to iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI Bot is a great way to search for some of your favorite things such as music, bands, and movies. Here is an explanation of how each command works:

node liri.js spotify-song

Using node Spotify, LIRI Bot will be able to display data about a song of your choice. Inputting this command will display the following:

<ol>
  <li>Artist: </li>
  <li>Song Name: </li>
  <li>Album: </li>
  <li>Preview of Song: </li>
  </ol>

<br>

node liri.js movie-this ''

Another function of LIRI Bot is that it is capable of searching for movies as well. This command will display the following:

<ol>
  <li>Title:</li>
  <li>Year:</li>
  <li>Rated: </li>
  <li>IMDB Rating:</li>
  <li>Language:</li>
  <li>Plot: </li>
  <li>Actors:</li>
</ol>
<br>

node liri.js band-this ''
<br>
The last function of LIRI Bot is that by inputting you're favorite band, LIRI will print information about the band. Some information it will display is as follows:
<br>

<ol>
  <li>City:</li>
  <li>Venue:</li>
  <li>Date of the concert: </li>
  </ol>
<br>

Thank you for checking out my LIRI Bot.
